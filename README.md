# xy_synth

xy_synth is a project that attempts to map the parameters of a syntheziser to an x-y-area. The idea derives from a project called flowEQ (https://github.com/csteinmetz1/flowEQ). As a first step an autoencoder to
generate preset files for the syntheziser Surge XT (https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge) using an autoencoder was build with TensorFlow (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). A similar project has been succesfully realised for the DX7 syntheziser (https://www.thisdx7cartdoesnotexist.com/). The project is still in development. Presets can be succesfully recreated, but they might crash on loading and don't sound as close to see original as desired.
