# xy_synth

xy_synth is a project that attempts to map the parameters of a syntheziser to an x-y-area. The idea derives from a project called flowEQ .

As a first step an autoencoder to generate preset files for the syntheziser Surge XT was build with TensorFlow. A similar project has been succesfully realised for the DX7 syntheziser.

The project is still in development. Presets can be succesfully recreated, but they might crash on loading and don't sound as close to see original as desired.
